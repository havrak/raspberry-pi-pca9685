# PCA9685 library using WiringPi

This library is a fork of [PCA9685 library made by vanvught](https://github.com/vanvught/rpidmx512/tree/master/lib-pca9685).
I have just changed it slightly to interface with i2c via WiringPi library and not directly with chip on rpi boards.

As of second half of 2021 wiringPi is no longer maintained and in standart repositories.
If you wish to use this library please use the [unofficial fork](https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi).
